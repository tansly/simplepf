 * Rule descriptor struct. This struct is what will be filled by userspace.
 * Each chain node will store one rule descriptor.
 * Fields that are used to match packets will be provided in network byte order.
 *
 * Fields are interpreted as follows:
 *  filter_* signify that if the rule will filter according to the following field.
 *  For example, if filter_saddr is true, the rule filters by the source addr,
 *  i.e. only matches packets with hdr->saddr == rule->ip_saddr.
 *  If all of the fields that has its respective filter_* field set to true
 *  match the incoming packet, we consider it a match. Otherwise, i.e. if any
 *  of the fields do not match, there is no match and we skip the rule.
 *  Think of it as a "logical and" operation.
 *
 * Note that if none of the filter_* are set, the rule matches ALL packets.
 *  TODO: Think of alignment/padding issues.
 *  XXX: We should not let anyone set port numbers for ICMP filters or
 *  ICMP types for UDP/TCP filters.
